REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.6.0.


INSTALLATION
------------
* Clone the repository
* Run ``composer install``
* Point your webserver to the ``htdocs`` folder
* Create and edit the db config file by copying the ``config/db_local.php.template`` to ``config/db_local.php`` and editing it's content

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
